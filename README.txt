#Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Assignment
##This Github repo was created for the assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data. Below consisted stages to follow in getting the data clean and tidy.
1. Download, unzip the data file into R working directory (WD).
2. Download the run_analysis file into R working directory(WD).
3. Execute the run_analysis file to generate a cleaned data file. (the cleaned data file named "tidydata" and allocate in your working directory.

##New dataset (tidydata.txt)
The new dataset were generated by the following steps:
1. merge train and test data into 1 data frame.
2. rename the columns based on feature.txt.
3. Create label that describe activities.
4. Rename the column names with appropriate labels.
5. Create new tidydata that only consisted mean and standard deviation of every subgroup (by subject and activity).

##The blueprint as given as the instruction of the assignment.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
